# todo_list_flutter_etiqa

A flutter mobile application

## Getting Started

This project used an approach of MVVM architecture with a Provider. Under todo_list folder got those 3 files(models,views,view_models);

#models
-the class of the todo list object defined

#views
-homescreen: display the list of todos
-add_todo_list: to add new todo item in the list

#view_models
-setup provider
-defined a variable of todo list
-defined functions of setter and getter

(SCENARIO)
1. User may add todo list item by clicking floating action button
2. User is required to insert todo list title (validation is available)
3. User choose the start and end date (default is the current date and time)
4. Upon successful, it will update the todo list in homescreen
5. User is able to check if the todo item has been completed and the status will change to "Complete"
6. User is able to edit the todo item by clicking the item, and click "Edit" if done
7. All changes will be updated

**no unit testing is implemented, still in a learning process
